# sptidy

An R package that produces a tidy output for tidymodels model evaluation!

## Introduction

Sptidy implements a `tidy` and `augment` function for base R's linear regression and Tidymodel's kmeans clustering to ease model selection and assessment tasks. This package is a simplified reimplementation of the existing `tidy` and `augment` functions in the Broom package. Sptidy’s family of tidy functions returns a dataframe that summarizes important model information, while the augment function expands the original dataframe to include additional model specific information by observation. This package is meant to complement [Sktidy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/sktidy), a Python package that was created to tidy up the scikit-learn package.  

## Features

The functions that this package currently support include:

- `tidy_kmeans()`: Returns inertia, cluster location, and number of associated points at the level of clusters in a tidy format.

- `tidy_lr()`: Returns coefficients and corresponding feature names in a tidy format.

- `augment_lr()` : Returns predictions and residuals for each point in the training data set in a tidy format.

- `augment_kmeans()` : Returns assigned cluster and distance from cluster center for the data the kmeans algorithm was fitted with in a tidy format.

## How sptidy fits into the R ecosystem 

[Tidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels) is a “meta-package” for modeling and statistical analysis that share the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse. One of the packages it includes is [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) which takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm, nls, or t.test, and turns them into tidy data frames. The tidy data refers to outputting the results in a `data.frame` where each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each value has its own cell. In `sptidy`, we implement the functions `tidy()` and `augment()` for the linear regression model from base R using the function [`lm()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lm) and the KMeans model from R `stats` package using the function [`kmeans()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/kmeans). 

## Installation

You can install the released version of sptidy from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("sptidy")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JacobMcFarlane/sptidy")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(sptidy)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
