Description: Sptidy implements a tidy and augment function for base R’s linear regression and Tidymodel’s kmeans clustering to ease model selection and assessment tasks. This package is a simplified reimplementation of the existing tidy and augments functions in the Broom package. Sptidy’s family of tidy functions returns a dataframe that summarizes important model information, while the augment function expands the original dataframe to include additional model specific information by observation. This package is meant to complement Sktidy, a Python package that was created to tidy up the scikit-learn package.
